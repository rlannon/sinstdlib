# SIN Standard Library

The standard library functions for the [SIN programming language](https://github.com/rlannon/SINx86).

## Getting Started

In order to compile the SIN Standard Library, you will need working C and SIN compilers because this project utilizes a combination of both C and SIN. Some functions, such as various typecasting functions, utilize pure SIN, but many functions simply utilize SIN wrappers for C functions (such as `print`, `input`, etc.).
